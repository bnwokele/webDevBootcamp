# Accident Incidents by Zipcode
We have built a web application that compares a single crime accident by zip code. When a zip code is selected by the user, we filter latitude and longitude within that zip code 
and visualize it on the map you see.
Here is a link to our Heroku Instance where the application can be used https://inst377project3.herokuapp.com
We want commuters figuring out the safest and quickest path for their commute to work or school to be an safe proccess, so please open this application on a web browser from a desktop or laptop. Although you will be able to find the app functional on mobile iOs and Android devices, for your safety, we have built the plaftorm to run best from home, where you will have the best experience for mapping your next trip around town or for simply keeping an eye out for criminal hotspots.
